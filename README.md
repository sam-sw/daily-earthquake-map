# Daily Earthquake Map

Live, minute-by-minute data from the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://usgs.gov)
plotted on an interactive map, showing earthquakes from the last day across the
globe. Visit the map at [earthquakes.samwood.me](https://earthquakes.samwood.me)
or by clicking on the screenshot below.

[![A screenshot of the Daily Earthquake Map website. The world map is centred about 0° latitude, 0° longitude, with North pointing upwards. Open Street Map's default tiles are used for the basemap; the sea is a pale blue and the land is beige. Locations of recent seismic activity are marked with red circles. The bigger the circles, the stronger the seismic activity. The more opaque the circles, the more recent the seismic activity. Thick grey lines span the whole map, indicating the boundaries of tectonic plates; this demonstrates how seismic activity is more concentrated around these plate boundaries. Text in the upper-right-hand corner includes timestamps for the current data, the number of earthquakes from this update, and an accuracy disclaimer.

## Building

Daily Earthquake Map is a static website, so only needs a web server to serve
its files. This repository has separated 'minifiable' files (HTML, CSS, JS,
JSON, etc.) from 'static' files (images, JavaScript libraries, etc.). To create
a single directory that can be served with a web server, either:

1. Copy the contents of [`src/`](src/) and [`static/`](static/) to a chosen
    output directory.
2. Use the provided Python [`build.py`](build.py) script. This has the added
    benefit of minifying source files.


### The Python `build.py` Script

The build script has been tested with Python 3.10. It has only one dependency:
[minify-html](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/minify-html). To install this,
first create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Then activate it, and install minify-html:

<details>
<summary>Linux and macOS</summary>

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip minify-html
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```batchfile
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip minify-html
```
</details>

To minify and copy files, first create an empty build directory in this
repository's root:

```bash
mkdir build
```

Then run the script (making sure you have the Python virtual environment
activated, and are again in this repository's root):

```bash
python build.py src build static
```

The `build` directory should now contain all the minified source files, and a
copy of all the static files. Note you can deactivate your Python virtual
environment (and return back to your usual shell) with:

```bash
deactivate
```


## Deploying

As a static site, only a web server capable of serving files is required. (In
fact, you can run without a web server by loading `build/index.html` in your
browser &mdash; only fetching the tectonic plate boundaries fails.) For
deploying to Netlify, a file with HTTP headers is provided
([`static/_headers`](static/_headers)) that has some sensible defaults (such as
disabling embeds, not sending a referrer on external links, and disabling
Google Chrome's browsing history ad-tracking). A
[`robots.txt`](static/robots.txt) is also set up to disable a variety of bots
from scraping any text content.
